### Here is basic problem solving using c++ topic is Array and For Loop

###### 1.Find sum of all element in one array i.e [1,3,4,5,5,6,7] is given array, please now find sum of 1+2+3+4.... N
###### 2.Find Only odd sum, means if you are given [1,3,4,5,5,6,7] this array, please find sum of odd numbers 1+3+5.... Nth Odd
###### 3.Find Only even sum, means if you are given [1,3,4,5,5,6,7] this array, please find sum of even numbers 1+3+5.... Nth even
###### 4.Find If a number exists in one array and find index number, for example if you are given [12,35,56,7] this array, and if you are asked to find 35 is in the array  or not your code should find this index number.
###### 5.Find Maximum number from this array [12,34,5,0];
###### 6.Find sum from 0 to N [use for loop or any formulae]
